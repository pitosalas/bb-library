* Site thumbnails not appearing, but I saw them on your site.

  We use paid Amazon Thumbnails service to display site thumbnails within
  the application. On our site we use our own account information and pay
  for every image we display. On your site, you need to use your Amazon
  services account to have them.

  Once you have your Amazon AWS account ready, enter your keys in the
  sites/config.php file, and verify that the cache directory is writable
  by your web server.
