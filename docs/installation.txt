Prerequisites
-------------

* Apache HTTP Server (2.0.x or later) with 'mod_rewrite' module installed
* MySQL Database Server (4.1.20 or later)

Installation Steps
------------------

1. Extract the contents of the "feedlibrary" folder from the distribution archive
   to a directory on the web server. Make sure the .htaccess file is extracted
   along with other contents of the archive (it has to be in the root directory).

2. Create an empty mysql database and run the following scripts from 'sql' folder
		* 1-ddl-script.sql 	  -- main structure
		* 3-data-script.sql   -- data script
		* 4-testdata-script.sql and 5-testdata-script-2.sql, if you wish some test data

3. Edit the global configuration file (sites/config.php). It is the
   default for all sites sharing this installation. If you have the only site,
   this is the only file to modify.
		* Specify your database details
		* Change the paths to mysql and mysqldump applications
		* Configure Amazon AST if you need thumbnails support

4. Ensure that all folders under sites/default are writable by the web server:
    * backups             -- database backups
    * images/people       -- pictures of users
    * sessions            -- application sessions
    * simple_cache        -- feed preview caches
    * smarty              -- custom configuration files
    * templates_c         -- pre-compiled templates
    * uploads             -- user uploads

5. Update your web server configuration with new virtual host. Assuming that
   the application root is '/var/httpd/library' and the name of the host is
   'lib.myhost.org', the virtual host config looks as simple as this:
   
     <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName   lib.myhost.org
       DocumentRoot /var/httpd/library
     </VirtualHost>
   
6. Ensure that the web server is allowed to read local .htaccess files

Periodical tasks
----------------

The application needs a pulse signal to perform some of the tasks in the background.
The tasks are Amazon AST cache cleaning, feed meta-data updates, database backups etc.
We recommend using crontab and 'wget' to ping the application every minute.

wget --spider -q http://your.library.url/pulse
