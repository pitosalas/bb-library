In this Agreement, the term "Software" means <B>BlogBridge Feed Library</B>, including 
computer software and associated media and printed materials, and may include 
online or electronic documentation. The term "you" means the company, entity or 
individual who is acquiring the license to use the Software under this Agreement; 
"both of us" means both you and us. The term "use" means storing, loading, 
installing, executing or displaying the Software.</P>

<H2>SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS.</H2>

<P><B>License Fee</B>. Except for Evaluation Licenses set forth below, this Agreement 
provides the terms and conditions of your use of Software upon your payment 
of the applicable license fee specified in a separate purchase order or similar 
memorandum between both of us ("License Fee"). This Agreement does not grant you 
any rights to use the Software unless and to the extent you have separately paid 
such License Fee.</P>

<P><B>License Grant - Usage in General</B>. Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, 
subject to payment of the License Fee, we grant you and you accept the non-exclusive, 
non-transferable right to use the Software in source or object code form, on a single 
computer.</P>

<P><B>Evaluation License</B>. We grant you and you accept the temporary, non-exclusive, 
non-transferable royalty-free right to use one copy of the Software in source or 
object form only, solely for evaluation purposes, but not for Commercial Use, during 
a one-time evaluation period of sixty (60) days from the date the Software is first 
used by you. "Commercial Use" means any use (internal or external), copying, 
sublicensing or distribution (internal or external), directly or indirectly, for 
commercial or strategic gain or advantage, including use in internal operations or 
in providing products or services to any third party. "Commercial Use" include use 
by an individual or non-profit (such as a university) in providing services to a 
third party. Evaluation for eventual Commercial Use is not "Commercial Use" so long 
as a commercial use license is obtained prior to Commercial Use.</P>

<P><B>Modifications</B>. You may modify the source code of the Software; provided, derivative 
works you make by modifying the code are subject to the restrictions of this license. 
We do not claim any rights to code you create separately from the code licensed 
hereunder and combine in a collective work, but you agree to provide any such 
collective work to third parties only pursuant to a license agreement non inconsistent 
with the protection of our rights hereunder.</P>

<P><B>Content</B>. To the extent that the Software enables you to access (on-line or otherwise) 
materials not supplied by us ("Content"), you should be aware that such Content is 
the property of the applicable Content owner and may be protected by applicable 
copyright law. This Agreement grants you no rights to Content.</P>

<P><B>Ownership</B>. You acknowledge and agree that the Software is owned and copyrighted by 
us or our third party suppliers. Your license confers no title or ownership in the 
Software and is not a sale of any rights in the Software. All ownership rights 
remain in us or our third party suppliers, as the case may be.</P>

<P><B>Copies</B>. Subject to payment of any applicable Licensing Fee, you may make copies of 
the solely for backup or archival purposes, for the purposes of making authorized 
modifications under the above provisions, or when copying is an essential step in 
the authorized Use of the Software. You must reproduce all copyright and other 
proprietary or restricted rights notices in the original Software on all authorized 
copies.</P>

<P><B>Transfer</B>. You may transfer your license to the Software only upon the terms of this 
section. You must deliver the original and all complete, partial or electronically 
stored copies of the Software and related documentation to the transferee. You may 
not retain any copies of the Software or related documentation, and any copies you 
have made which you have not transferred to the transferee you must destroy. Your 
license will automatically terminate upon any transfer of the Software. You have 
no right to sublicense, loan, rent or lease the Software.</P>

<H2>THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE.</H2>

<P>We may provide to you certain software which is specifically labeled as being 
provided by and/or owned by third parties ("Third Party Materials"). You shall 
be licensing such Third-Party Materials directly from the third party provider, 
including the right to use such Third Party Materials in connection with the 
Software.</P>

<P>Certain of the Third Party Materials supplied by us for use with the Software 
are governed by open-source software license agreements supplied with such Third 
Party Materials, such as the GNU Public License. We make no claim of ownership 
of such open-source software, and such software is supplied solely in accordance 
with the license agreements accompanying such software. Accordingly, the 
restrictions above under "SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS" concerning scope of use, 
ownership, modification, confidentiality and other provisions relating to the 
Software do not apply to such open-source software. However, the disclaimer of 
warranty and limitations of liability below under "SOFTWARE WARRANTY" and 
"LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY" do apply to such Third Party Materials.</P>

<H2>SOFTWARE WARRANTY.</H2>

<P><B>Limited Warranty</B>. We warrant that, for a period of 30 days after purchase, the 
Software will function substantially in accordance with its documentation. As 
your exclusive remedy for breach of this warranty, we will, at our option, either 
replace or repair the defective Software or refund all fees paid for it, provided 
that you purchased the Software directly from an authorized dealer or from us; and 
you destroy all copies of the Software and provide the dealer from whom it was 
acquired (or us, if acquired directly) with certification of such destruction and 
proof of purchase, within thirty days of purchase.</P>

<P><B>Evaluation Copy Exclusion of Warranty</B>. EVALUATION COPIES OF SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED 
FREE OF CHARGE OR AT A NOMINAL COST, AND ACCORDINGLY ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE WARRANTIES 
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</P>

<P><B>Warranty Exclusions</B>. This warranty does not cover damage due to external causes, 
including accident, abuse, misuse, problems with electrical power, servicing not 
authorized by us, usage not in accordance with product instructions, failure to 
perform required preventive maintenance, and problems caused by use of parts and 
components not supplied by us.</P>

<P>Because software is inherently complex and may not be completely free of errors, 
you are advised to verify and back up your work. Additionally, we do not guarantee 
compatibility between the Software and any future versions of the Software.</P>

<P><B>Limited Warranty -- General</B>. THIS IS A LIMITED WARRANTY AND IT IS THE ONLY WARRANTY 
MADE BY US. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL OTHER 
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</P>

<P>OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR MALFUNCTIONS AND DEFECTS IS LIMITED TO REPAIR AND 
REPLACEMENT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.</P>

<P>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY, SO THIS 
DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY 
BY JURISDICTION.</P>

<H2>HOSTING SERVICE TERMS.</H2>

<P>In addition to the license of Software set forth in this Agreement, we may provide 
the Software as a hosted service (the "Service") to you on the following terms.</P>

<P><B>Payment for Services</B>. You agree to pay all charges, recurring fees, applicable 
taxes and other charges (collectively herein "Charges") incurred by you at the 
rates in effect for the billing period in which those charges are incurred. 
Charges may include among other things, annual fees for access, and fees for 
usage of disk space on our Servers. Current prices for our services are posted 
on <A HREF="http://www.blogbridge.com/products-services/feed-library/licensing-and-pricing/">Licensing and Pricing</A> page.
We reserve the right to change prices and institute new fees. We may change rates
or institute new charges at any time upon 30 days prior notice.</P>

<P>Except for software provided by us and the Server usage provided by our third 
party providers, you are responsible for providing and maintaining all equipment 
and other software necessary to access the Service. The third party provider 
hosting the Service is responsible only for Servers necessary to provide the 
Service. You are responsible for obtaining internet access to the Service and 
any charges relating thereto.</P>

<P>For most billing plans we will be charging your designated credit card monthly, 
but some charges are billed on a different schedule. You are responsible for 
all charges incurred, including applicable taxes and purchases made by you or 
anyone who is using an authorized user Account that you have caused to be created 
or for which you have otherwise indicated your agreement to be responsible for 
payment. This means that, unless your Account or credit card information is 
obtained unlawfully or fraudulently, you will be responsible for all usage and 
purchases made on your card. You should let us know about any billing problems 
or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your Account statement. 
If you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you agree that you 
waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Additionally, if 
any charges are being collected by us on behalf of a supplier, then such supplier 
shall be an express third party beneficiary of this section.</P>

<P><B>Your Information</B>. You agree to provide accurate, complete and up-to date 
information as requested by us in connection with your use of the Service.</P>

<P><B>Confidentiality and Security of Service</B>. You agree that neither we nor our 
suppliers shall, under any circumstances, be held responsible or liable for 
situations where the data stored or communicated through the Service are 
accessed by third parties through illegal or illicit means, including situations 
where such data is accessed through the exploitation of security gaps, 
weaknesses or flaws (whether known or unknown to us at the time) which may 
exist in the Service. In particular, we do not warrant that any information, 
software or other material accessible via the Service is free of viruses, 
worms, trojan horses, or other harmful components. We may store and facilitate 
the transmission of private electronic communications pursuant to the 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. Electronic communications on 
this system are private, and only under situations where explicitly required 
or allowed by law will such communications be accessed, intercepted, 
disclosed, or used without the consent of at least one of the parties to the 
communication.</P>

<P><B>Privacy Policy</B>. Information you supply is subject to our 
<A HREF="http://www.blogbridge.com/about/privacy/">privacy policy</A>.</P>

<P><B>Conduct</B>. You agree that your use of the Service and the Software used to 
provide the Service will be in a manner consistent with this Agreement and 
with all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation, 
copyright, trademark, and export control laws, and laws prohibiting the use 
of telecommunications facilities to transmit illegal, obscene, harmful to 
minors, threatening, harassing, or other offensive information or messages. 
You agree not to use the Service to transmit or to facilitate the transmission 
of unsolicited bulk commercial e-mail.</P>

<P><B>Your Content</B>. We do not claim ownership of any content you place on the Service. 
By submitting content to us for use on the Service, you grant us a worldwide, 
royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify and publish the 
content on the Service. You represent and warrant to us that you have the right 
to use and publish the content you make available via the Service. We do not 
pre-screen content, but we have the right to refuse or remove any content that 
is available via the Service. This includes the right to remove any content that 
violates this Agreement or we otherwise find objectionable.</P>

<P><B>Advertisements and Promotions; Links</B>. We may run advertisements and promotions 
on the Service, including on pages created by you. We or third parties may provide 
links to or from your web pages to other web sites or resources. Because we have 
no control over these, we are not responsible for them, and we do not endorse 
and are not responsible for any content, advertising, products, or other 
materials on or available from these other linked sites or resources.</P>

<P><B>Disclaimer Relating to Services</B>. We make no warranty as to the results to be 
obtained from your use of the service. The service is performed on an "AS IS" 
and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or 
implied, including but not limited to warranties of title or implied warranties 
of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. You assume full 
responsibility and risk for use of the Service and the Internet. In particular, 
we do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.</P>

<P><B>Amendment and Termination of Service</B>. We may revise the terms and conditions 
of this Agreement with respect to Services at any time, effective immediately 
upon posting of the revised Agreement on our web sites, or upon notification 
to you by e-mail or United States mail. You agree to periodically review our 
web sites, including the current version of this Agreement available on our 
web sites, to be aware of any such revisions.</P>

<P>We may terminate your use of the Service, and remove and discard any content 
within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack 
of use or if we believe that you have violated or acted inconsistently with 
the letter or spirit of this Agreement. We may also at any time modify or 
discontinue providing the Service. We may do either of these things with or 
without prior notice. We will not be liable to you or any third-party for 
any of these actions.</P>

<P>You may terminate this Agreement with respect to Services at any time by notice 
to us. Your notice of termination will be effective on receipt and processing 
by us. Any fees paid by you if you terminate your agreement for Services with 
us are nonrefundable, but you will not incur any additional fees.</P>

<H2>SUPPORT SERVICES</H2>

<P><B>Support Services Generally</B>. We may make maintenance services available under 
maintenance program(s) which may be in effect from time to time, subject to 
payment of applicable fees. In general, unless otherwise specifically agreed 
to, support is email-based. Inbound emails are queued, measured in severity, 
assigned a case, and tracked through completion. We use reasonable efforts to 
respond and resolve Software errors in a reasonable manner, but cannot promise 
that any particular error will be resolved in any particular timeframe. We shall 
have no obligation to provide services in connection with the installation or 
integration of the Software by you or training of your employees; and such 
services, if desired by you, shall be arranged separately and shall not be 
covered by the fees paid by you under this Agreement. In general, response 
time is prioritized based on the issue severity. From time to time we discontinue 
support for older versions.</P>

<P><B>Services Warranty</B>. We warrant that support services are performed in a 
commercially reasonable manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. 
Any breach of such warranty must be reported to us with 30 days of the provision 
of the support services. As your exclusive remedy for breach of this warranty, 
we will, at our option, either re-perform the service or refund all fees paid 
for services by you in the preceding 12 month period. THIS IS A LIMITED WARRANTY 
AND IT IS THE ONLY WARRANTY MADE BY US. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, 
WE DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</P>

<H2>LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY</H2>

<P>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL 
THEORY, TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER 
PERSON FOR ANY MONEY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
COVER, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF WE SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.</P>

<P>IN THE EVENT THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, WE ARE FOUND LIABLE TO YOU FOR 
DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION 
(WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE), 
OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNT YOU 
PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE.</P>

<P>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</P>

<H2>GENERAL.</H2>

<P><B>Export Controls</B>. None of the Software or underlying information or technology 
may be downloaded or otherwise exported or reexported (i) into (or to a national 
or resident of) any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to 
anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals 
or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders. By downloading or 
using the Software, you are agreeing to the foregoing and you are representing 
and warranting that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national 
or resident of any country to which such export is so prohibited or on any such 
list. In addition, you are responsible for complying with any local laws in your 
jurisdiction which may impact your right to import, export or use the Software, 
and you represent that you have complied with any regulations or registration 
procedures required by applicable law to make this license enforceable. If the 
Software is identified as a not-for-export product (for example, in the installation 
process), then, unless you have an exemption from the United States Department 
of State, additional restrictions may apply.</P>

<P><B>U.S. Government End Users</B>. The Software is a "commercial item," as that term is 
defined in 48 C.F.R. 12.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer 
software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are 
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users 
acquire the Software with only those rights set forth herein</P>

<P><B>Term</B>. Your license under this Agreement is effective until terminated. Your 
Evaluation License terminates automatically in accordance with the provision 
of this Agreement set forth above. You may terminate this license at any time. 
We may terminate this Agreement immediately if you breach any of the provisions 
of this Agreement. Upon any such termination or expiration, you must discontinue 
all use of the Software, and immediately destroy the Software together with all 
copies. The provisions of this Agreement (other than your license to use the 
Software) shall survive the termination of the license, or the termination or 
expiration of this Agreement.</P>

<P><B>Controlling Law and Severability</B>. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement 
between both of us with reference to this transaction. This Agreement will be 
governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA, except for that 
body dealing with conflicts of law. The application to this Agreement of the 
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is 
hereby expressly excluded. In the event of any dispute involving this Agreement, 
both of us consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in either the state or 
federal courts in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and agrees that the prevailing 
party shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney fees and costs. In the event 
any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed unenforceable, void or invalid, 
such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid and enforceable, and as 
so modified the entire Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. No 
decision, action or inaction by us shall be construed to be a waiver of any rights 
or remedies available to us.</P>
